## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Backend Setup (Server)

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TanmmayRJoseph/CloudeNote.git

Navigate to the Server folder:

bash
Copy code
cd CloudeNote/Server
Install the backend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the Server directory.
Add your MongoDB connection string:
env
Copy code
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The server should now be running on http://localhost:5000 (default).

Frontend Setup (Client)
Navigate to the Client folder:

bash
Copy code
cd ../Client
Install the frontend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the frontend development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The React app should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Note:
Make sure your backend server is running before starting the frontend server to avoid any connection issues between the client and server.

Usage
Once the servers are up and running, open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the CloudeNote app. Here you can:

Create, view, and edit notes on the homepage.
Delete any notes you no longer need.
The app automatically syncs with the backend and stores your notes in MongoDB.
